"""
Growing.py: sensitivity of landscape's keepf/grow knobs (see Growing.md).

SWAY [Chen'18] used keepf=0.5, grow=2; ezr2 defaults to 0.66, 4.
We draw 100,000 random (keepf, grow) points from the grid
keepf in {0.50..0.80}, grow in {2..10}, over 20 datasets x 20 seeds, and
record the win DELTA vs the SWAY baseline (0.5, 2) on the same
dataset+seed. The baseline grid point reads exactly 0.
Output: Growing.png heat map + an ASCII grid on stdout.
